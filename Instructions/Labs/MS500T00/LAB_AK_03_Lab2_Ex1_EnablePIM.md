# Module 3 - Lab 2 - Exercise 1 - Manage Azure Resources


**Scenario**

In this lab, you will learn how to use Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time administration and control the number of users who can perform privileged operations. You will also learn about the different directory roles available as well as newer functionality that includes PIM being expanded to role assignments at the resource level. 


### Task 1: Discover resources

1.  If you are still logged into the Microsoft 365 admin center as MOD Administrator switch users to Holly Dickson. Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/) as Global Administrator Holly Dickson, click **More services** and search for and select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1.  Click consent to PIM if it appears. In some tenants PIM is already enabled and therefore these steps are unnecessary.
